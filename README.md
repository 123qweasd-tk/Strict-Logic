# Strict-Logic
Programs with strict logic (by Walther Brüning) content

Strict Logic is a theory by Walther Brüning stated in his book "Grundlagen der Strengen Logik" in 1996.

His approach is wide. It all starts only with one difference and therefore one "Sachverhalt" (circumstance [variable]) and one complement-"Sachverhalt". This fundament is expanded by one "Sachverhalt" more. And so on, and so on. 

In his book he identifies syllogism as a subtheory. For more details:

This program (in python) is simple and only for demonstration purpose, although it can calculate all 24 modes of traditional syllogistic and all other two-valued logical formula conclusions with two premisses, all with a preceeding contradiction testing.

syllogisms -> contains only traditional syllogisms
syllogisms with contradiction testing -> contains also contradiction testing

User guide (file syllogisms.py):
Put in a first premis. For instance: 'MaP', also written as 'auna'.
Put in a second premis. For instance: 'SaM', also written as 'auna'.
Your result is the conclusion. (Here: Babara)

User guide (file syllogisms with contradiction testing.py):
See before. Your result also shows a contradiction testing.

For more details look at the pictures.

Have fun!
